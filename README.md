It's not much of a game, but I'm glad you saw that clue and came to visit. Consider signing VISITORS.md by opening a pull request.

Consider also forking this repo and making your own game. There's almost literally nothing to it!

What is there is licensed under the MIT license, so do whatever you want with any of this.
